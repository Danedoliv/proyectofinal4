                    <p class="lead wow fadeInUp">Globally renowned dance music festival and the largest brand in Insomniac's scope of events and productions. EDC began in 1997 as a warehouse party in Los Angeles, produced by CEO and Founder, Pasquale Rotella. Since then it has grown into an internationally acclaimed live music experience, attracting nearly one million fans annually, on four different continents around the world.
                        <br><br>
                         EDC is an unique multi-day festival pushing the boundaries of imagination, and setting standards in the live entertainment industry. By incorporating carnival themes and attractions, cutting-edge stage production, world-class talent, and innovative art and technology, EDC is more than an electronic music festival - it is an unparalleled multi-sensory experience unlike any other. The brand has created a passionate community of accepting fans that have turned EDC into a way of life. The foundation upon which the phenomenon was built is one of unity, love, self expression, and respect for one another.
                        <br><br>
                        EDC Las Vegas is the largest dance music festival in North America and currently takes place in Mexico, Florida, and Japan as well.</p>

                <p class="lead wow fadeInUp">Founded by two brothers, Manu and Michiel Beers in 2005, Tomorrowland is an Electronic Dance Music festival which has grown steadily ever since its humble foundation. The first edition brought together 500-1000 party-goers, however already in its third edition, there were over 50,000 attendees. The 2019 edition touted as the most expensive in terms of production (organisers decline to confirm exact figures), welcomed 400,000 visitors over two weekends and featured over 1000 artists in 18 stages spread over the massive 38 hectares area. 
                    <br><br>
                    Over 2 million people registered for tickets from every single country in the world (including North Korea, Afghanistan, and Syria) and “only” 400,000 lucky people, with an average age of 27 and oldest being the local resident aged 83 who has visited the festival since its beginning, got the opportunity to buy the tickets. And boy did they buy. The festival was sold out in just 45 minutes (Only Glastonbury sold out quicker, in 36 minutes, but that festival hosted “only” 267,000 attendees). The festival is rumoured to make consistently over €20 million ($22 / 18 GPB)) in profit, however the production costs are closely kept secret, but one can imagine they are very high.
                    <br><br>
                    Over 15,000 members of staff (none of which were volunteers) worked there, which is more than many music festivals, with over 500 members of international media who took part. Over 2 million beer pints were sold during the two weekends, paid with Tomorrowlands own currency, Pearls. Tomorrowland also dwarfs other music festivals (or almost any other kind event on Earth) in the online world: only on Facebook, they have over 14.7 million followers (in comparison Coachella has just 2.7 million followers...), and their famous Facebook live emission had over 210.000 live viewers at its peak with over 718 million impressions. And then there is the famous Tomorrowland Aftermovie, which are over 20 minute long movies that seem to be put together by Hollywood level production team and consistently pull in over millions of views. According to several insiders, all DJ’s earn the exact same amount, which makes it even more fascinating, when taking into consideration that global superstar DJ’s such as Armin van Buuren and Tiesto would earn the same as the upcoming first time DJ playing on the smallest stage. Talking about the stages, each stage has their own crazy theme from the fire spewing Dragon stage to the Mushroom stage and waterfall stage (not official names) to the incredible Main stage with its mind-blowing audio visuals accompanied with floating dancers and fireworks. There aren’t really enough words to describe the level of production at the stages, one must simply experience them in person.</p>

                <p class="lead wow fadeInUp">
                    Q-Dance is a Dutch company that organizes events and festivals that focuses on  the harder styles of dance music – mainly Hardstyle, Hardcore, and Hard Trance. Popular events and festivals organized by Q-Dance are Defqon.1 Festival, Qlimax, Qapital, Impaqt, EPIQ, and X-Qlusive. The events of Q-Dance are easily identified by the letter “Q” on the event names. The logo of Q-Dance is inspired by the knobs on DJ mixers, which if turned 120 degrees to the right creates the letter “Q”.
                    <br><br>
                    Founded in 1999 as Qlass Elite by a couple of friends in the northern suburbs of Amsterdam (Landsmeer, the Netherlands). The first event created by Qlass Elite was Houseqlassics, an event that played old school house music. After two editions of Houseqlassics, in the year 2000 a few more events were scheduled for the year: 91-92 and Qlimax. A year later, in 2001, the name of the company was changed into Q-dance and a new concept was introduced: Qlubtempo.
                    <br><br>
                    With this concept Q-dance introduced a whole new music genre: Hardstyle. This new genre of dance music grew in a few years as one of the most popular dance genres and is still the main type of music played at Q-dance events. And it's the same Q-Dance that coined the term Hardstyle around the world on July 4, 2002. In 2002 Q-dance decided to expand the Qlimax event by moving to a bigger venue, Thialf stadion in Heerenveen, the Netherlands. Qlimax grew fast and soon it was clear that the venue at Heerenveen was too small to hold the event. Qlimax was soon held in a bigger venue in the GelreDome in Arnhem, the Netherlands. Until this day the Qlimax events take place each November in the GelreDome.
                    <br><br>
                    In 2003 on Bloemendaal beach, the Netherlands, Q-dance built a beach club named Q-beach. In the weekends small parties and talent shows were organized at Q-beach. After two summers Q-dance decided to pull the plug on Q-beach. In 2003 three new concepts were introduced: Defqon.1 Festival, X-Qlusive and the techno concept Teqnology.</p>
